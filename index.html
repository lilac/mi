        <p><em>Mi</em> is an (experimental) modern practical functional programming language. It can be seem as a dialect of the Standard ML language, however is not intended to conform to the SML standard.</p>

<ul>
<li>The 'm' in the name can be interpreted as "meta" or "modern";</li>
<li>and the 'i' means "intuitive" or "intelligent".</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="the-motivations-of-this-language-are" class="anchor" href="#the-motivations-of-this-language-are" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The motivations of this language are:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ecosystem &gt; Standard</p>

<p>The history of SML told us a non-restricted standard is worse than nothing. The incompatibility of different SML implementations makes the SML community fragmented, as you can hardly find or write a library that works on all SML implementations. Ocaml does not have a standard, but this does not prevent it owning a better ecosystem than SML.</p>

<p>To have a good ecosystem, the language's toolchain should help documentation, testing, library distribution and etc. For instance, it is expected to have documentation generator, test framework and package manager built in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User experience &gt; Efficiency</p>

<p>In most circumstances, the adoption of a (new) language relies more on the user (developer) experience of the language than the performance of compilers or interpreters.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="why-based-on-standard-ml" class="anchor" href="#why-based-on-standard-ml" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why based on Standard ML?</h3>

<ul>
<li>The standard ML language is well defined, and its syntax is more coherent and cleaner than that of Ocaml.</li>
<li>As a strict language, Standard ML is more user friendly than Haskell, which is non-strict and pure.</li>
</ul>
